# Command Line: Bash Scripting Workshop

This workshop teaches the basic of bash scripting. 

Workshop covers the material from
[Software Carpentry Command Line Workshop](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
and 
[Data Science at Command Line](https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com)

You'll need to download [Data Files](https://github.com/nuitrcs/bash_hpc_workshops/blob/master/shell-novice-data.zip) for this workshop.

## Software

On Mac OSX, which is based on a Unix environment, you can use the built in terminal program (found in the Utilities folder of the Applications folder).

Windows, which is not Unix based, does not come with a bash shell.  Please [install GitBash](https://workshops.rcs.northwestern.edu/install/bash/).
